1.Environment variables store data that's used by the operating system and other programs
Environment variables are used to store app secrets and configuration data, which are retrieved by your running app when needed.

Production ready->
1. Use Environment variables ->avoid hard coded values in our code like secret-keys etc
2. Use production API keys -> not the testing API keys like stripe
3. Reduce Error Output details -> Don't send sensitive information to your users.
4. set secure response headers -> implement best practices.

//often handled by the hosting provider
5. add asset compression -> reduce response size
6. configure logging -> stay up to date about what's happening
7. Use SSL/TLS ->ENCRYPT DATA IN TRANSIT

Process .ev->

The process. env global variable is injected by the Node at runtime for your application to use and
 it represents the state of the system environment your application is in when it starts. 
For example, if you set a PORT variable in the system, it can be accessed through theâ€¯process.env.PORT variable
 because, when we set an environment variable, it is loaded into process.env during runtime and can later be accessed. 


 Helmet can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately.
Generally, Helmet is just a collection of smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP headers
